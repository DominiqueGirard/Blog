Euthanasia and physician-assisted dying (EAD) have been legalized in an increasing number of countries in Europe, North and South America, and Oceania, given certain eligibility criteria. After public and political debate, some countries broadened their interpretation of the law, or introduced amendments to the law, expanding access to this end-of-life choice. For example, in Canada, the reasonable foreseeability of death criteria was removed with Bill C-7 passage in 2021, opening the door to non-terminally ill individuals (such as people with degenerative illnesses) to seek EAD.
With the continuing changes in law and health policy, we now encounter various individuals requesting EAD, ranging from patients with cancer to those diagnosed with dementia or mental illness (in some countries). Consequently, the experience of suffering in the EAD context is also becoming more diversified and complex to assess. 

Our research engages in interdisciplinary inquiry to better understand the experience of suffering leading to a request for EAD. Our research also focuses on how patients, close ones, and healthcare professionals navigate the social and ethical challenges through the EAD process. 

The PATHOS project may help build bridges between the experiences of individuals requesting EAD, their close ones and healthcare professionals. A better understanding of the diversity of experiences in the EAD context is crucial to support meaningful interventions and practices aligned with the needs of patients, their close ones, and the healthcare professionals involved.
