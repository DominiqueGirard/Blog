My name is Dominique Girard, and I am a postdoctoral fellow at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. I secured a postdoctoral scholarship from the [Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Société et Culture](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/society-and-culture/).

I am a French Canadian from Montreal, and I moved to Utrecht in October 2021. I am thrilled to be here as working on existential, ethical and moral issues, particularly at the end-of-life period, has been a big part of my research interests for a few years. In my free time, I like to spend as much time as possible doing outdoor activities in nature. I love art in all its forms, including painting, dancing, and music! 

Regarding my academic experience, I trained as a clinical psychologist at Université du Québec à Montréal, where I also completed my Ph.D. on the predictors and correlated of intelligence in preschool autistic children, using a neuropsychological approach. What motivated me to do a postdoctoral fellowship with [ Prof. Dr. Els van Wijngaarden](https://www.elsvanwijngaarden.com/) lies in my doctoral courses. Both through my clinical and research implications, I have been in contact with the suffering of my patients, my thesis’ participants, and their families. Most of the time, it seemed that this suffering did not emerge from the patient's perception of themselves or their symptoms but rather from knowing that their differences would lead to incomprehension from others, marginalization, and stigma surrounding their diagnosis. These experiences sparked my curiosity and led me to conceptualize suffering as the result of a complex dynamic between a person and the environment rather than an intra-individual experience.

While at Radboud UMC, I will be working with [ Dr. Els van Wijngaarden](https://www.elsvanwijngaarden.com/) on a research project titled Towards a better understanding of the concept of suffering in the context of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide: a longitudinal study involving patients, relatives, and physicians.
