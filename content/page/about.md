My name is Dominique Girard, and I am a postdoctoral fellow at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. I previously completed a bachelor's degree (B.Sc) in psychology from University of Montreal and did my PhD in psychology at the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM), where I trained as a clinical psychologist (Psy.D) and as a researcher (Ph.D).

My current research interests revolve around the contemporary meaning of ageing, death and dying, the cultural and ethical challenges  arising in the healthcare context at the end-of-life, and the way patients, close ones and healthcare professionals navigate through these challenges. 

While at Radboud UMC, I will be working with [ Dr. Els van Wijngaarden](https://www.elsvanwijngaarden.com/) on a research project titled Towards a better understanding of the concept of suffering in the context of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide: a longitudinal study involving patients, relatives, and physicians. My research is currently funded by the [Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Société et Culture](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/society-and-culture/) as well as [Stichting de Zaaier]( https://www.stichtingdezaaier.nl/?pagina=Bestuur).   

In my free time, I like to spend as much time as possible doing outdoor activities in nature. I love art in all its forms, including painting, dancing, and music!
