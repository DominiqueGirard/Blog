In July 2023, the [**Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Société et Culture (FRQSC)**](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/society-and-culture/) awarded me a Knowledge Mobilization Plan (B3ZR) postdoctoral fellowship.

The FRQSC B3Z3 scholarship will enable me to maximize the impact of research funded by the FRQSC by contributing to the knowledge and expertise sharing outside the academic community and implementing of mobilization and transfer activities for potential users of research results, namely policymakers, practice sector audience and general public. The fellowship will begin in November 2023 and has a duration of 1 year.

My wonderful colleague [**Marte Fleur Antonides**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marte-fleur-antonides-5929409a/), MA, MD, PhD candidate will join me in planning and deploying the mobilization plan.
