The PATHOS project focuses on the meanings and interpretations of suffering as experienced by patients, close ones, and healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) through the euthanasia and physician assisted suicide (EAS) process.

The Netherlands was the first country worldwide to have legalized EAS in 2002. Euthanasia corresponds to the administering of a fatal dose of a suitable drug to the patient on their express request and intends to relieve suffering by accelerating death. Assisted suicide is distinct from euthanasia in that the physician supplies the drug, but the patient administers it. In both cases, the physician must ensure that the statutory due care criteria are fulfilled. 

Central to the EAS law is the presence of unbearable suffering without any prospect of improvement and the lack of a reasonable alternative. Although the concept of suffering is at the heart of this law, it is vaguely defined, and very little research focuses on this concept. An overview of the literature shows that the interpretation of suffering differs among patients, physicians, and close ones. Indeed, some studies show that physicians interpret suffering as physical pain, while patients would conceptualize their suffering more from a psychological, social, or existential angle. This misunderstanding of suffering may lead to medical interventions that fail to alleviate or contribute to it. Other studies highlight situations where relatives struggled to recognize the severity of the patient’s suffering and thus failed to empathize and accept the patient’s assisted death request.

Furthermore, despite knowing that there are several stages to the EAS process (e.g., discussions on eligibility, the time point when EAS is requested, and the doctors' decision), which may include each trigger different emotions and reactions amongst those involved, most studies do not follow participants over time, and thus, do not account for the possible variation of the participants’ experience of suffering during the EAS process. 

**Our objectives** are to understand better the different perceptions and experiences of suffering in an EAS request. We also want to understand better how doctors and relatives of patients – who are also involved in the euthanasia process – perceive the suffering of the patient and the EAS process itself. 

The PATHOS project addresses these objectives using qualitative, multi-perspective, and longitudinal approaches. By bringing together the patient, the close ones, and the treating physician, we will observe the interactions between these actors and how they experience and perceive suffering in this context. 

The project’s comparative approach and qualitative empirical detail will hopefully contribute to the quality of the assessment process by improving the conversation about the experience of suffering in the EAS context. 

The PATHOS project is hosted by the Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, Netherlands. The supervisor of this project is [ Prof. Dr. Els van Wijngaarden](https://www.elsvanwijngaarden.com/).

# FRQSC funding #

The PATHOS project has been funded by the [**Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Société et Culture (FRQSC)**](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/society-and-culture/). 

The FRQSC's mission is to promote and provide financial support for research and dissemination of scientific knowledge in social sciences and humanities and the fields of education, management, arts, and literature. 

The FRQSC grants are awarded through open competition to support the training of the next generation of experts in social sciences, humanities, arts, and literature; to foster the mobility of young researchers towards stimulating and dynamic scientific environments, such as universities and university-affiliated service centers; and to facilitate integration into new networks and the development of new collaborations. 

The criteria for selection are based on academic excellence, quality, the research project's originality, and the host environment's relevance.
