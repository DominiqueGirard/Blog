**About the conference**

***Title***  Better understanding the experience of suffering in the context of medical aid in dying: a meta-synthesis combining the perspective of patients, their loved ones and health professionals

***Date*** Thursday, May 18, 2023, from 12:15 to 1:15 pm

***Speaker*** Dominique Girard, PhD, RQSPAL partner member and post-doctoral researcher at Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc), Nijmegen, The Netherlands. 

***Description*** With the expansion of eligibility criteria for medical assistance in dying (MAID), we are encountering a greater diversity of patients with a request for MAID. As a result, the experience of suffering in this context is also becoming more diverse and complex to assess. This meta-synthesis aims to better understand the experience of suffering leading to a request for MA by combining the perspectives of patients, their families and health professionals.

This conference was presented jointly with the Centre for Research and Intervention on Suicide, Ethical Issues and End-of-Life Practices [(CRISE)](https://crise.ca/en/).
