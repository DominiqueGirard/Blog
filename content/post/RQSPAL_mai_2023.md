**About the conference**
***Title***  Better understanding the experience of suffering in the context of medical aid in dying: a meta-synthesis combining the perspective of patients, their loved ones and health professionals

***Date*** Thursday, May 18, 2023, from 12:15 to 1:15 pm

***Speaker*** Dominique Girard, PhD, RQSPAL partner member and post-doctoral researcher at Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc), Nijmegen, The Netherlands. 

***Description*** With the expansion of eligibility criteria for medical assistance in dying (MAID), we are encountering a greater diversity of patients with a request for MAID. As a result, the experience of suffering in this context is also becoming more diverse and complex to assess. This meta-synthesis aims to better understand the experience of suffering leading to a request for MA by combining the perspectives of patients, their families and health professionals.
