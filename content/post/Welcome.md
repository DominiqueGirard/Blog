I have the pleasure to launch my research blog! For the next few years, I will work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Netherlands, collaborating on exciting new projects as part of the ‘Zingeving en Ethiek rond Ouder worden en Sterven’(ZINOS) group!

My current projects revolve around ethical questions and contemporary meanings of aging, death and dying! On this platform, I will share with you the evolution of my current research projects, resulting publications as well as news and events on related topics!
