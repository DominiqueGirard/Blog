As a humanistic psychologist, I believe that we can come to a greater understanding of ourselves through arts (e.g., poems, paintings, dance, photography). 
<!--more-->
Indeed, our interpretation as well as our emotional experience in front of a work of art will differ from one person to another. Interpreting is not simply an intellectual experience, but also a deeply emotional and subjective one. Hence, the way we influence and are influenced by a work of art speaks to us about our subjectivity and our unicity.

In parallel of my main lines of research surrounding aging, end-of-life and dying, I also explore these themes via hermeneutical and phenomenological analyses of arts.
