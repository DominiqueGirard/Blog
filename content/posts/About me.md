My name is Dominique Girard, and I am a postdoctoral fellow at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. I secured a postdoctoral scholarship from the Fonds de Recherche du Qu√©bec ‚Äì Soci√©t√© et Culture. I am a French Canadian from Montreal, and I moved to Utrecht in October 2021 along with my partner Maxime, who will also complete a postdoctoral fellowship during our stay. I am thrilled to be here as working on existential issues, particularly at the end-of-life period, has been a big part of my research interests for a few years. In my free time, I like to spend as much time as possible doing outdoor activities in nature. I love art in all its forms, including painting, dancing, and music! Finally, I like to describe myself as a cinephile (a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy) and a licorice root tea lover!

Regarding my academic experience, I trained as a clinical psychologist at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, where I also completed my Ph.D. on the predictors and correlated of intelligence in preschool autistic children, using a neuropsychological approach. What motivated me to do a postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. van Wijngaarden lies in my doctoral courses. Both through my clinical and research implications, I have been in contact with the suffering of my patients, my thesis‚Äô participants, and their families. Most of the time, it seemed that this suffering did not emerge from the patient's perception of themselves or their symptoms but rather from knowing that their differences would lead to incomprehension from others, marginalization, and stigma surrounding their diagnosis. These experiences sparked my curiosity and led me to conceptualize suffering as the result of a complex dynamic between a person and the environment rather than an intra-individual experience.

While at UvH, I will be working with Dr. Els van Wijngaarden on a research project titled Towards a better understanding of the concept of suffering in the context of Medical Aid in Dying: a longitudinal study involving patients, relatives, and physicians.

When we think about Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD), we must also consider psychological suffering. A better understanding of the suffering of people who wish to have recourse to MAiD would allow them to be better supported and alleviated. To date, psychological suffering is little studied in MAiD, while this type of suffering occupies a preponderant place in the reasons for opting for MAiD. In addition, although the end-of-life context involves end-of-life patients, relatives and doctors, no study has been conducted on the influence of individual perceptions on suffering. Finally, it would be interesting to document the conception of suffering through the MAiD process since it is likely to vary over time. Our objectives are to 1) better understand psychological suffering as experienced by patients, relatives, and doctors in the context of MAiD, and 2) describe the evolution of the interpretation of this suffering over time, between the time of request for information about MAiD and the time of death. We hope that the results from this project will make it possible to 1) orient future research and propose recommendations to better support and relieve all those involved in the experience of medical assistance in dying, 2) promote a more systemic vision of this relatively new social phenomenon and 3) improve clinical practices, satisfaction and communication in the care offered.
