As part of my postdoctoral fellowship, I lead a research project called Perspectives and Theoretical Analyses of Suffering in the Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Dying context (PATHOS). 
<!--more-->
The [PATHOS project](https://pathosproject.wixsite.com/pathos) aims to better understand the meaning of suffering in the context of a request for Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide in The Netherlands. I am using a multiperspective approach, bringing together the perspectives of patients, close ones, and healthcare professionals via qualitative interviews. 

The PATHOS project is hosted by the Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, Netherlands. The supervisor of this project is [Dr. Els van Wijngaarden](https://www.elsvanwijngaarden.com/).

The PATHOS project has been funded by the [**Fonds de Recherche du Québec – Société et Culture (FRQSC)**](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/society-and-culture/), [**Stichting de Zaaier**](https://www.stichtingdezaaier.nl), and the [**Hypatia Grant**](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/radboudumc-hypatia-track-and-grants).
