Over the past decades, the social and cultural settings of death has profoundly changed. In a recent Lancet report on death and dying, it has been argued that health care is now the main context in which many people encounter death, with an increased focus on end-of-life choices and interventions to control or avoid suffering, illness, and dying. 
<!--more--> My current research interests revolve around the contemporary meaning of ageing, death and dying, the cultural and ethical challenges  arising in the healthcare context at the end-of-life, and the way patients, close ones and healthcare professionals navigate through these challenges. In the next sections, you will find a description of my current projects.
